# Contribution-of-citizen-science-to-the-production-of-butterfly-species-long-term-trends

This repository contains the codes used for the analyses performed in the article Contribution of citizen science to the production of butterfly species long-term trends.

All the steps were performed on R version 4.3.0 (R Core Team, 2023), and the calculation of temporal trends and inter-annual variations required the use of a cluster.

This repository contains two sections:

A. Temporal trends and interannual variations
This section contains the scripts used to estimate temporal trends and inter-annual variations for each of the monitoring schemes.

B. Model traits
This section contains the script used to estimate similarity and dissimilarity indices, and to test the effect of some butterfly traits and monitoring schemes characteristics on both similarity and dissimilarity indices to understand potential differences in congruence of species/species groups trends and interannual variations between schemes.
